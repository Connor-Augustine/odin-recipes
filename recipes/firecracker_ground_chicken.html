    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger (or 1 tsp fresh grated ginger)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>Cooked rice, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the firecracker sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup buffalo hot sauce (e.g., Frank's RedHot)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespooon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for extra hear)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together buffalo hot sauce, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and red pepper flakes (if using). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground chicken and cook, breaking it up with a spatula, for 5–7 minutes or until fully cooked and browned.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger. Sauté for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour the firecracker sauce over the cooked chicken. Stir well to coat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5–7 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and absorb into the meat.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed—add more hot sauce for spice or brown sugar for sweetness.</li>
        <li>Spoon over a bed of steamed rice or lettuce cups, and garnish with chopped green onions if desired. Serve hot!</li>
