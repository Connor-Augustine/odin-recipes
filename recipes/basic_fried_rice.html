    <h3>Ingredients (Serves 2-3)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked rice (preferably cold, day-old rice)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tables of vegetable oil (or any other neutral oil)</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped green onions (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mixed vegetables (e.g., peas, carrots, corn)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If not already done, cook the rice and let it cool completely. Cold rice works best to avoid clumping. Chop vegetables and crack the eggs into a small bowl, beating them lightly.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour in the beaten eggs. Stir and cook until just set, then remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining oil to the pan. Stir-fry the garlic for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the mixed vegetables and cook for 2–3 minutes until heated through and slightly tender.</li>
        <li>Add the cold rice to the pan. Break up any clumps with your spatula and stir-fry everything together for 2–3 minutes until evenly combined and heated.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in the soy sauce and sesame oil (if using). Stir to coat the rice evenly. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Return the scrambled eggs to the pan and toss in chopped green onions. Mix well and cook for another minute to combine all flavors.</li>
        <li>Serve hot as a main dish or side. Enjoy!</li>
